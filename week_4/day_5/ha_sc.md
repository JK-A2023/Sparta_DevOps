# HA-SC

## What is it?

### High Availability and Scalability

1. Scalability:
   1. Able to elastically change Horizontal (number of resources) or Vertical (power of resources) resources to match demand
   2. Scale up / down how many VM's you have.
   3. Scale up / down how much storage capacity you have.

2. HA:
   1. An environment that is able to continue to provide resources over a period of time.
      1. Load Balancing: Spreading requests among two or more resources to average out demand, as opposed to over stressing one resource.
      2. Multiple availability zones: If one availability zone is to fail, having your resources spread over mdifferent zones reduces the likelihood of all of your resources failing at the same time, meaning you can continue providing value.
