# Why Python?

#### Here are some reasons as to Pythons popularity

1. Extensive Libraries - Comprehensive standard library that provides packages, so that developers can utilize them rather than having to always write out code that already exists as established modules.
2. Readability and Simplicity - Clear syntax, high-level language that is easy to read.
3. Popularity - Pythons existing popularity helps bring in new developers. This active community helps to contribute to the rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that developers can use.
4. Versatility - As it is a general purpose language, Python can be used in a range of programming projects, from web dev to data analysis, machine learning, and more.
5. Open Source - It is free to use as you want, distribute as you please, and modify in any way an individual sees fit.

### Where is Python used?

1. Machine Learning / Data Science: Libraries such as NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, and more, can all be used within machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.
2. Web Dev: Django and other similar libraries to build web applications.
3. Networks: Can be used for building network applications and even automate cross-network tasks. 
4. Automation Scripting: Python can be used to write automation scripts to help automate repetitive tasks, and even for system administration.
5. Applications: Python can be used  to build desktop applications.

### Why use Python in DevOps?

1. Integration - Python can integrate with other tools and services easily, making it an ideal solution that can act as a bind between multiple DevOps tools.
2. Existing Libraries - Python has a huge pool of libraries, and a wealth of frameworks that can help DevOps tasks.
3. Scripting and Automation - Concise syntax and the pool of libraries / frameworks make it a prime candidate for DevOps use, as it can be widely used for scripts writing and automation tasks to make the DevOps pipeline easy. These tools can help with monitoring, deployment, and configuration.
4. Ease of Use - Simplicity, simple syntax, high-level language, and general writing capability makes Python perfect for rapid and iterative development in DevOps.
5. Cross-Platform - Python runs easily on all operating systems and platforms, with minimal set up, ease of use, and quick to import / download libraries, allowing for easy and consistent use across different systems.

### What is a script?

A script is a program written in a scripting language, such as Python, that is interpreted and executed line by line. 
Usually for used for automating tasks, or working with the operating system, or controlling over software components.
These scripts are usually shorter than entire programs. Removes toil.

1. Development Time: Scripts, due to their short nature, are often quick to be written and iterated, making them perfect for tasks that don't require heavy optimisation or blazing performance.
2. Complexity: Scripts are usually much less complex than fully fledged programs.
3. Execution: Scripts are interpreted, whereas programs are compiled. Programs are translated into machine code before execution, whereas scripts are executed line by line by an interpreter.
